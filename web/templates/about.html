                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p>SnowFinder analyzes historical snowfall data from 62+ Japanese ski resorts (seasons 2014-2025) sourced from SnowJapan.com to help you find the best powder conditions.</p>

                <h2>Peak Period Detection Algorithm</h2>
                <p>Our algorithm identifies the top 5 snowiest periods for each resort using a sophisticated approach:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Rolling Window Analysis:</strong> We scan through historical data using flexible 2-7 day windows to capture both short intense dumps and sustained snowfall periods.</li>
                    <li><strong>Prominence Scoring:</strong> Peaks are ranked not just by total snowfall, but by how much they stand out from surrounding periods - identifying true powder bonanzas rather than seasonal averages.</li>
                    <li><strong>Statistical Validation:</strong> Each peak is assigned a confidence level (high/medium/low) based on data consistency across multiple seasons, ensuring reliable predictions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Multi-Year Averaging:</strong> Dates represent historical patterns across all available seasons, smoothing out year-to-year variations to reveal true seasonal trends.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The algorithm balances total snowfall volume, daily intensity, and statistical significance to surface the periods when resorts historically receive their best conditions. Confidence levels indicate data reliability: "high" means 4+ years of consistent data, "medium" means 2-3 years, and "low" means limited historical coverage.</p>
